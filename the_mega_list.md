# RB101/RB109 MEGA-LIST
> This is a file where I will be collecting as many lessons and important material from RB101. </br>
>
> **My goal with this document:**
> 1. Provide concise and exact definitions for common terms. </br> 
>     _(Refer to "Defining Terms" sections)_
> 2. Provide walkthroughs of the material
> 3. Provide practice questions with answers (that you can toggle to show/hide) from both the course material and my own creation.
