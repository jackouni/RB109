## Variables as Pointers to Objects üëâ
In Ruby variables should be thought of as pointers that point to objects in memory. </br>
They should not be thought of as containers that hold objects. </br>
<br>

_**To reiterate:**_ </br>
Variables are used to point you to an object for referencing. </br>
They don't _hold_ objects in memory, they point to the spots in memory that hold objects.

<br>

## Differences: Arrays üÜö Hashes 
#### Arrays:
- Are a collection of indexed objects 
- Maintain an order starting from `0` index, `1` index and so on...
- Retrieve an object using the index it's located at in the array
- Arrays can have duplicate values

#### Hashes:
- Are a collection of objects paired with a 'key'
- Rely less on order. Objects in the Hash are referenced by a 'key'
- Retrieve an object using the 'key' that references it
- The 'keys' in a Hash are unique and CAN'T be duplicated.
<br>

#### Retrieval of Items:
_Arrays:_
```ruby
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

arr[0] #=> 2
arr[1] #=> 4
arr[2] #=> 6
arr[4] #=> 10
```
_Hashes:_
```ruby
hash = {a: 2, b: 4, c: 6, d: 8, e: 10}

# Referencing keys:
hash[:a] #=> 2
hash[:b] #=> 4
hash[:c] #=> 6
hash[:e] #=> 10

# Using `fetch`
hash.fetch(:a) #=> 2
hash.fetch(:c) #=> 6
hash.fetch(:e) #=> 10
```
> _**To Note**_ üìù </br>
> #### Accessing a hash value using square bracket notation V.S. `fetch`: </br>
> With **square brackets**, even if you insert a key that does not exist, the square brackets will return `nil` to you. </br>
> This can cause some confusion in your application when trying to debug. </br>
> Often times we want to avoid the returning of `nil`.</br>
> <br>
> With **`fetch`**, if you insert a key that doesn't exist it will throw an error. This is nice because this means we can avoid returning `nil` and be more aware of error-prone code we write. 
>
> _Example:_
> ```ruby
> hash = {a: 2, b: 4, c: 6, d: 8, e: 10}
>
> p hash[:f] #=> nil
> p hash.fetch(:f) #=> Will throw an error
> ```
<br>

## Iterators üîÑ

### Defining Terms üìñ
- _**Iterators**_
  > Are methods in Ruby that allow us to iterate through the items in a collection (Arrays and Hashes). These methods keep us from having continue writing out our own loops repetitively. </br>
  With the use of blocks, iterators can allow us to inject our own custom logic into the iterative loop. </br>
  These iterators can make our code more concise and readable. </br>
  _Some common examples include:_ </br>
  > - `Array#map`
  > - `Array#each` / `Hash#each`
  > - `Array#select` / `Hash#select`
  > - `Hash#each_key` 
  > - `Hash#each_value`
  >
  > These are all examples of methods that perform some sort of iteration over the elements in a collection in order to achieve a certain result or return value.
<br>

- _**Blocks**_
  > A block is code that is passed to a method at invocation. </br>
  Code in a block is contained between either: </br>
  > 1. A `do/end` (multi-line)
  > 2. Curly braces, `{}` (one-liner) 
  >
  > Blocks can be thought of as "arguments" to methods, although not technically true. Blocks are a way to pass code to a method (much like how we pass objects as arguments to methods). </br>
  > Blocks are verys similar conceptually to the idea of '_callbacks_' in other languages like JavaScript. </br>
  > <br>
  >
  >  _Here's an example of implementing a block into a method and then invoking that block:_
  >```ruby
  > arr = [1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
  >
  > def my_map(array)
  >  i = 0
  >  new_array = []
  >
  >  loop do
  >    item = array[i]
  >    new_array << yield(item) # Where we hand control over to the block
  >    i += 1
  >    break if i == array.size
  >   end
  >      
  >  new_array
  > end 
  >
  >
  >p my_map(arr) { |x| x * 2 } # `x` represents `item` from our method definition
  ># => [2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30]
  >```

- _**Loops**_
  > Loops are a way to execute code multiple times consecutively, depending on certain logic. </br>
  > <br>
  > _Loops are blocks of code defined by (in order):_
  > - a 'looping' keyword (like `loop`, `while`, `until` ... etc)
  > - a **_condition_** (unless the loop is defined by the `loop` keyword) 
  > - By **_the code_** contained/wrapped between a `do/end`.
  >
  >**_The code_** defined in the loop will execute over and over again until the **_condition_** is met or if the `break` keyword is invoked within the loop definition.

## One of The Biggest Mistakes Beginners Make

According to the founder or Launch School, Chris Lee, one of the common mistakes beginners make when using methods is not having a good definition. </br>
<br>
When using methods, make sure you have a good definition of what that method does. </br>
_**Does it...?**_
- Mutate the Caller?
- Return a meaningful value/object?
- Return a boolean?
<br>

_**If iteration, is it...?**_ 
- Returning the last evaluated expression in a block?
- Returning the item from blocks that return a certain boolean (`true`/`false`)?
- Returning a boolean based on a certain conditional being or not being met?
<br>
<br>

These are all things to consider when using a method. 
If you have trouble explaining what the method does, 
it starts you off on rocky grounds and may make it harder for you to debug if ever you encounter a problem with that method.
